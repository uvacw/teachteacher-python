    "In this exercise you will work with supervised machine learning. We will classify tweets into four categories namely: normal, abusive, hateful, and spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps that we need to take before we can use supervised machine learning. Namely:\n",
    "* Collect data (in CS often texts, e.g., tweets)\n",
    "* Develop a codebook and hand-code the data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we focus on the actual machine learning part of the process. Hence, we will use a database that already has been coded humans. It contains tweets and each tweet has a label indicating to which of four categories it belongs, namely normal, abusive, hateful, or spam. Hence, we skip the first two steps of the process described above.\n",
