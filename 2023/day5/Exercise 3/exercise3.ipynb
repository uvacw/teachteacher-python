    "### Q1: Describing Supervised Machine Learning (SML)\n",
    "\n",
    "a. SeeFlex is a video streaming platform that initially focused solely on television shows aimed at children. However, the CEO recently decided to expand the content available on SeeFlex to content aimed at adults as well. New availble genres on SeeFlex are, for example, horror shows or dating shows. To help customers select content and mostly, to help parents to keep selecting only content that is suitable for their children, the CEO wants to employ Supervised Machine Learning (SML) to automatically indicate the genre that a specific piece of content belongs to based on its description. She can do this because she got her hands on a large dataset with pre-labeled content descriptions which she can use to train and validate machines. \n",
