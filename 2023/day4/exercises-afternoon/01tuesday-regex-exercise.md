# Exercise with regular expressions

Let’s take some time to write some regular expressions. Write a
script that

• extracts URLS form a list of strings  
• removes everything that is not a letter or number from a list of
strings  


```python
list_w_urls = ["some text with a url http://www.youtube.com... ",
"and another one!! https://www.facebook.com",
"more urls www.baidu.com??",
"And even more?!! %$##($^) https://www.yahoo.com and this one http://www.amazon.com and this one www.wikipedia.org" ]
```
