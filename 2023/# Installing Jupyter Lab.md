# Installing Jupyter Lab

To ensure a smooth start for everyone, we ask you to download and install the Jupyter-Lab Desktop program: https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop/tree/master 

Please scroll down and download the respective installer for your system (Windows/Mac/Linux). When opening JupyterLab for the first time, you will see a small message at the bottom (see screenshot below). Please then click on “install using the bundled installer” to start the installation process, restart JupyterLab, and we should be good to go! If you encounter errors, do not worry, we will have enough time on Monday to make sure everyone — regardless of their computer or operating system — will be operational!
