The two figures gave speeches during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. President Trump said the pollution in China is significantly worse than in the US and urged activist Greta Thunberg focus her efforts there. Conversely, Prince Charles said we are "amidst a crisis" and citizens of the world must commit to preventing climate change. Nigel took exception to the future king's speech, saying as a member of the Royal Family he should remain apolitical. He did acknowledge that both said we should do something, but sided with President Trump's more "relaxed" approach. #NigelFarage #ClimateChange #LBC LBC is the home of live debate around news and current affairs.

Is it simply to create value for shareholders, or is it to guarantee certain social goods, like work, decent wages and environmental sustainability? Traditionally an American might answer that question differently than a European. But now, with climate change looming, and inequality persisting, skepticism over traditional shareholder capitalism is coming from all corners. And it's finding full voice at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Her appearance at the opening of the World Economic Forum was a striking sign that the debate about how to stop the Earth warming has become mainstream in business circles. Yet only a handful of executives from the oil, gas and coal industries that are chiefly responsible for warming the planet were seen attending the panel at which¬†Thunberg¬†spoke on Tuesday. Meanwhile, U.S. President¬†Donald Trump¬†used his speech at the event to tout the benefits of soaring American oil and gas production and make a thinly veiled attack on those who warn about looming environmental catastrophe. ‚ÄúThe climate and environment is a hot topic right now, thanks to young people pushing,‚Äù 17-year-old¬†Thunberg¬†said at the Swiss ski resort, where about 3,000 business and political leaders gather each year. ‚ÄúPretty much nothing has been done, since the global emissions of CO2 have not reduced.‚Äù The Swedish activist‚Äôs words came as the World Economic Forum sounds alarm bells on climate change. This year and for the first time on record, environmental risks occupy the group‚Äôs¬†top five¬†long-term concerns, while corporate executives say they‚Äôre¬†increasingly concerned¬†about environmental issues. But young activists at Davos said none of this is enough. Thunberg¬†is giving relevance to the Davos gathering, which for years has suffered from criticism that it was largely a billionaires‚Äô playground where the rich debated among themselves without hearing outside voices. On Tuesday, there was a full room at this first 8:30 a.m. panel featuring young activists -- something relatively unusual for a climate change event at Davos. The debate on climate change is forcing businesses to respond to demands to stop carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. While some have been slow in embracing the fight, executives at Davos highlighted that the overall views from within the business community have dramatically changed over the last decade or so, moving from denial and questioning science into complete acceptance. ‚ÄúI have come to Davos for well over a decade and I see behind the scenes, among top executives, a huge change in perception of the risk of climate change,‚Äù said¬†Marco Dunand, the head of Mercuria Energy Trading SA, one of the worlds‚Äô largest oil traders. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just talk: it‚Äôs translating into billions of dollars in investments in the energy transition.‚Äù Activists‚Äô language has made its way to boardrooms across the world too. At another morning panel at Davos, Iberdrola SA Chief Executive Officer¬†Ignacio Galan¬†called on companies to close coal-powered plants in order to curb emissions.	25	News & Politics	PT7M56S	476	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dretZCOvMzw/maxresdefault.jpg	1	14589	235	292	0	363

David Puttnam looks at Climate Change through different lenses, all of which reveal the unsustainable ways in which we are living. Climate Change is real, but throughout history humans have failed to set political and economic concerns aside for our greater good. Will we ignore this latest warning? Lord David Puttnam produced award-winning films including Chariots of Fire, Bugsy Malone, and The Mission. He now works at the intersection between education, media, and policy. In 2007 he was appointed Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT16M35S	995	2d	hd	false		1	537670	6146	1554	0	3286

The scientists who work at this outpost in Antarctica are studying the effects of climate change -- under extreme conditions. Journalist Matthias Ebert traveled to the station to find out more about their research. The scientists are particularly concerned about the speed at which Antarctic ice is melting - and its impact on global sea levels. The researchers have also been studying a large colony of emperor penguins that lives near their facility -- to find out more about how these birds are adapting to climate change. Ebert reports on the daily lives of the scientists who work at the Neumayer Station, and how they cope with the extreme weather conditions, isolation, and cramped quarters. They've even managed to grow some of their own food in a greenhouse at the facility. Ebert documents the damaging effect that global warming is having on the Antarctic, and the risk that this poses for the rest of the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra. Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee. _______ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

The potential for replanting in the Philippines is great, because it is one of the most deforested countries on the planet. In 1900, tropical rainforests covered more than 70 percent of the archipelago. By 1990, that tree cover had plummeted to 19 percent. In 2011, a presidential order created the Philippines National Greening Program with a goal of reforesting 3.7 million acres, an area about the size of Connecticut. In 2015, the plan was expanded to 5.6 million acres.

Without me! | DW Documentary (climate documentary)	Record heat, forest fires, drought ‚Äî global warming is increasingly noticeable in Europe too. The climate crisis appears unavoidable. But most people are continuing to eat, fly and consume just as they always have. In Germany, many are talking about the need to protect the climate, but few are taking action. This report asks: can humanity still save itself? Dedicated climate activists are seeking to hold a mirror up to society through protests and blockades, resorting to drastic measures at times. Their protests may grab the headlines, but to what extent do they resonate with those attending the Cruise Days in Hamburg or the IAA motor show in Frankfurt? Then there‚Äôs always the question of how much can one person actually do to stop climate change, and how much is down to the politicians? And does banning things really help? One problem that stops effective action in Germany is the lack of public trust in politicians. In the eastern state of Thuringia, for example, citizens' initiatives were set up to protest the building of the ‚ÄòSuedlink' underground power line, designed to transport wind-generated energy from the north to supply areas in the south. It‚Äôs one of the key infrastructure projects in Germany‚Äôs planned switch to a low-carbon, nuclear-free economy. Residents along the route don‚Äôt want the landscape in their area being dug up for energy that wouldn‚Äôt benefit them personally. Clearly it‚Äôs not easy to introduce measures to stop climate change in a society with insufficient public trust and little sense of solidarity. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

U.S. President Donald Trump has given the opening speech at the summit, which is taking place as the Senate in Washington prepares to open his impeachment trial. The president used his address to pitch the United States to the global business community, saying the country has seen an economic turnaround that is "nothing short of spectacular." He also used the platform to criticize climate change activists like Greta Thunberg, who is also in Davos. She said combating climate change is not about politics.

Climate Change is the bad news story that isn‚Äôt going away From heatwaves to hurricanes, from droughts to floods Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, putting lives at risk Human activity is causing our climate to change The CO2 emissions from our cars, our industries and our power plants are heating up the planet To prevent further dangerous levels of climate change Countries around the world signed up to the Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees To stop the planet getting warmer, we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels And increase the share of renewable energy, like from wind, solar and low carbon sources Climate action is everyone‚Äòs responsibility: governments, businesses, communities, individuals The actions we can take to reduce our carbon footprint, like investing in green technologies can also reduce costs and create jobs The risks and costs of inaction are too high to ignore. So what are we waiting for? The time to act is now.

Dr James Rae is a climate scientist in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews. His research uses the chemistry of sediments, ice, and fossils to reconstruct past climate change. He‚Äôs particularly interested in the drivers of the ice ages, the climates of the dinosaurs, and reconstructing CO2 over geological time. Before coming to St Andrews, James held a prestigious NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship at Caltech, and studied at the Universities of Bristol and Oxford. In 2015, James won the European Geosciences Union Outstanding Young Scientist Award in Biogeochemistry, for his contributions to understanding past climate change and its causes. When not in his lab in the Purdie Building, you can find him running, surfing, or biking in the Scottish great outdoors, and occasionally playing the bagpipes. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

And now, the dangers caused by tons of melting ice are rising sharply. Every year, climate change is destroying two of the currently 70 square kilometers of glaciers left in the Alps. The permafrost in the Alps is thawing, and transforming what used to be sturdy slopes into loose screes. In addition, climate change is leading to significantly more extreme weather conditions every year, while heavy rainfall causes serious erosion. The result: avalanches and landslides like those in Bondo, Switzerland, or Valsertal in Austria. In Switzerland, residential areas are shrinking as people are forced to leave their homes forever. The disappearance of glaciers as water reservoirs is already posing a major problem. Farmers in Engadine, who have been using meltwater for irrigation for centuries, are already facing water shortages. Last summer, they had to rely on helicopters to transport water to their herds in the Grison Alps. Above all, alpine villages depend on winter tourism to survive. Yet experts are forecasting that by mid-century, there will only be enough natural snow left to ski above 2,000 meters, which will spell out the end for about 70 percent of the ski resorts in the Eastern Alps. But instead of developing alternatives, lots of money is still being invested in ski tourism. Snow cannon are used to defy climate change, and artificial snow systems are under construction at ever higher altitudes. As usual, it‚Äôs the environment that is set to lose as the unique alpine landscape is further destroyed by soil compaction and erosion. Some municipalities are now working on new models of alpine tourism for the future. As global temperatures continue to rise, the cooler mountain regions will become increasingly attractive for tourists, especially in the summer. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Trees are burning up around the planet at an alarming rate and impacting the climate. Now a new effort to plant as many trees as possible has taken hold around the globe. But will it mitigate climate change? In California, 3 million acres have burned since 2017. And in Brazil, some 121,000 fires have burned since January ‚Äî more than half in the Amazon rainforest. The fires have cost the planet millions of trees, one of the Earth‚Äôs best defenses against climate change. Now a movement around the globe is trying to replace trees lost to fire and deforestation for agriculture or grazing. In Ethiopia, the prime minister announced a new #GreenLegacy initiative that planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours. Even YouTube stars are getting in on the act: More than 600 social media personalities recently raised over $16 million to plant trees worldwide. The effort was led by Jimmy Donaldson, a YouTube star who‚Äôs also known as MrBeast. Reforestation is also a big part of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. recently abandoned at the behest of President Donald Trump. But can planting billions and billions of trees really mitigate climate change? For that matter, is it even feasible? ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

For years, scientists have studied the world's oceans by sending out ships and divers, deploying data-gathering buoys, and by taking aerial measurements from planes. But one of the better ways to understand oceans is to gain an even broader perspective - the view from space. NASA's Earth observing satellites do more than just take pictures of our planet. High-tech sensors gather data, including ocean surface temperature, surface winds, sea level, circulation, and even marine life. Information the satellites obtain help us understand the complex interactions driving the world's oceans today - and gain valuable insight into how the impacts of climate change on oceans might affect us on dry land.	28	Science & Technology	PT5M16S	316	2d	hd	false			47043	177	8	0	7

Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of our time. Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050 - the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections? Join climate scientist expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing. By the end of this course, you will: -Develop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing; -Articulate WHY the climate system is changing; -Understand the nature of these changes; -Develop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.	27	Education	PT2M15S	135	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vP00TP6-p0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2314	43	21	0	0

But how much can trees really do to tackle global warming? See our research here: https://econ.st/32HXvXY Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Summer 2019 - More than 38,000 fires raged across the Amazon. Fires that were man-made. Over the past 50 years almost 17% of the world‚Äôs largest rainforest has been cleared. And globally deforestation has almost doubled in just five years. Since the start of human civilisation it‚Äôs estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half. Clearing forests increases carbon-dioxide levels but planting them could store away some of the carbon already in the atmosphere. This woman runs safaris in England. Guests are not only here to see wild animals - they‚Äôre here to see wild trees. Almost 20 years ago Isabella Tree‚Äîyes that is her real name-handed 1,400 hectares of Sussex farmland back to nature, by doing, well nothing. She thinks this is the best way to use the land to help tackle climate change. To stabilise the climate global carbon emissions need to drop to net zero by 2050. Simon Lewis is a professor of global change science. And there‚Äôs never been more global ambition to plant trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square kilometres of forest by 2030 - an area slightly larger than India. The 2030 target looks likely to be met. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Ä¶ Monoculture tree plantations like eucalyptus grow quickly but the trees are harvested every ten or so years releasing much of the carbon stored in the tree back into the atmosphere - which means that, according to some studies they‚Äôll store only around one-fortieth of the carbon natural forests do over the long term. In fact, those pledges to plant millions of trees actually promise to store 26bn tonnes less carbon than they could. Sometimes the motives for planting forests are less green than they might appear. By 2020 Ireland ought to have cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels. But at current rates it will have reduced them by only 5%. Planting forests might help Ireland avoid massive penalties for missing EU targets because the potential carbon these forests could store in the future can be counted as a carbon credit today. In the 1920s Ireland had the lowest forest cover in Europe at around 1%. That‚Äôs now risen to 11% and the government has set a target to cover 18% of the land with forest by 2046. And now local community groups are protesting against these monoculture tree plantations. They say they‚Äôre doing more harm than good. Tree-planting programmes invariably have an impact on the people living nearby. In east Africa one project is demonstrating what can be achieved when there‚Äôs genuine buy-in from the local communities. Green Ethiopia is a mixed-tree planting charity. The land is communally owned and co-operatives of local women receive benefits for planting trees which are protected from being harvested. Here conserving is just as important as planting. Green Ethiopia assesses whether the condition of the land is good enough to regenerate by itself. When it is‚Äîon about a third of the area the charity runs they leave it alone. Just like Isabella Tree, back in England. Monoculture plantations are often preferred because they make money.

Andrew Winston answers tough business questions about the climate crisis. Big shifts need to happen in business so the world can avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But it can be difficult to know what your role is in this process‚Äìand you may even wonder whether you can make a difference at all. Does what you do as an entry-level employee or a small business owner really matter? Can we get where the science tells us we need to be within capitalism? And is it worth being optimistic when the planet seems doomed? Andrew Winston, the author of the Big Idea article ‚ÄúLeading a New Era of Climate Action,‚Äù https://hbr.org/cover-story/2020/01/leading-a-new-era-of-climate-action, can help. HBR approached him with some questions and concerns people may have about climate action ‚Äìand some questions we had ourselves. --------------------------------------------------------------------- At Harvard Business Review, we believe in management. If the world‚Äôs organizations and institutions were run more effectively, if our leaders made better decisions, if people worked more productively, we believe that all of us ‚Äî employees, bosses, customers, our families, and the people our businesses affect ‚Äî would be better off. So we try to arm our readers with ideas that help them become smarter, more creative, and more courageous in their work. We enlist the foremost experts in a wide range of topics, including career planning, strategy, leadership, work-life balance, negotiations, innovation, and managing teams. Harvard Business Review empowers professionals around the world to lead themselves and their organizations more effectively and to make a positive impact.

Floods, cyclones and droughts are likely to increase as the Earth warms. Poor farmers are already trying to adapt. Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2Hea5EK Melting glaciers, droughts, rising sea-levels - these are just some of the environmental disruptions that are likely to worsen with climate change. But dangerous climate change is not just something that might happen in the future. The earth is already warmed by almost 1 degree Celsius since the dawn of the Industrial Age - the effects are already being felt now. Vulnerable communities are trying to adapt. Bangladesh is more at risk from climate change than almost any other country. It's prone to flooding, cyclones and drought. Climate change may already be exacerbating those things. Bangladesh sits at the bottom of a Delta plane were three main rivers converge. It's straddled by the melting Himalayan glaciers in the north and the rising waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south. That makes it highly susceptible to flooding. In 2009, cyclone Aila tore through Bangladesh, uprooting trees, flattening homes and destroying crops. Along the southern coastal regions the storm left behind salty water in areas it had inundated. Fields that had once support agriculture were deemed useless. To adapt to their newly saline environment, locals have had to change their source of food production. Through a project funded by the World Bank villagers have switched to raising crabs which thrive in saltwater. Villagers rear the crabs and sell them at a local market where they're then resold by buyers who shipped them to Dakha. Adding to this problem, in some areas farmers deliberately inundate their lands with salty water so they can farm shrimp rather than crops, which is more profitable but problematic for the environment. But the salinity creates another daunting problem - it pollutes local groundwater and makes it more difficult to access safe drinking water. Climate change is worsening this effect. Cyclones are more common, river flow has diminished, and salty water from the Bay of Bengal has been reaching ever farther into the coastal lands travelling up rivers and polluting freshwater supplies that are used for drinking and irrigation. NGOs working with the Community Climate Change Project has sought to address this problem. They've provided water tanks so locals can harvest rainwater and have helped fund a desalination plant that provides clean drinking water. In the north of the country, local livelihoods have also been threatened by water. Many villagers are beholden to the rivers. When the rivers flood, the soil used for agriculture has disappeared. Not only have they lost their homes and their crops but also their means of survival. In Ranpur, villagers have learned a new farming technique that works on sandbars or chars where all the soil has been eroded. Farmers dig out holes in the char fill them with compost and plant pumpkins. Pumpkins are preserved and can be sold during the rainy season providing income throughout the year. Adaptation projects such as the ones being carried out in Bangladesh have had a huge impact on those involved but Bangladesh is not the only place where the effects of climate change are already being felt and adapted to. Rotterdam is building floating pavilions to pilot a city that rises with its sea levels. London will improve the Thames Barrier so it can better protect the city from floods. A decade ago adaptation was almost taboo in international discussions about climate change because it was believed to distract attention from the vital task of stopping global warming altogether. Now those are recognized as important. But can keep them in poor countries like Bangladesh adapt quickly enough? We don't know yet. Richer countries are better able to withstand the potential shocks that climate change will bring. If change is slow enough, it gives people more time to act and increases the odds of success. World leaders tend to talk about stopping climate change. It would help poor farmers enormously if it could only be slowed down. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

Discredited 18th-century economist Thomas Malthus still haunts the environmental debate. ---------------- Subscribe to our YouTube channel: http://youtube.com/reasontv Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Reason.Magaz... Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/reason Subscribe to our podcast at Apple Podcasts: https://goo.gl/az3a7a Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines. ---------------- "We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth," said climate activist and¬†Time magazine person-of-the-year Greta Thunberg before the United Nations in the summer of 2019. "How dare you!" Some praised Thunberg's performance as a stinging rebuke to the rich and powerful for failing to put the survival of the planet above their own needs. Others saw the exploitation of a young woman with emotional problems for propagandistic ends. There's no question that Thunberg's style of environmentalism‚Äîstrident, urgent, and critical of global capitalism‚Äîhas gained a strong foothold in contemporary politics. A 2019 paper from the journal Bioscience, co-signed by more than 11,000 scientists, asserted that Earth's population "must be stabilized‚Äîand, ideally, gradually reduced." And some politicians have questioned the morality of having children at all. Whether contemporary proponents of these ideas know it or not, they are all the intellectual heirs of the misguided 18th-century thinker Robert Thomas Malthus, who believed that when human population increased, famine and environmental destruction would ensue. Reason's science correspondent Ron Bailey, who is the author of the 2015 book The End of Doom: Environmental Renewal in the Twenty-first Century,¬†says that Malthus failed to see that as human population increased, so too would livestock and crop populations with the help of ever-improving agricultural technology, which is why food availability steadily increased over the past two centuries, outpacing population growth. "Basically, the Malthusian prescription turns out to be completely wrong," says Bailey. is it really possible that the world could run out of food? While the International Food Policy Research Institute projects that farmers will have to produce 70 percent more food over the next 30 years to feed everyone on the planet, the technology already exists to accomplish that goal. Agronomist Paul Waggoner calculates that if all farmers became as efficient as today's U.S. corn growers, the world could feed 10 billion people today on half as much land. Today's Malthusians are most concerned about the disruptive effects of climate change. Citing global warming and habitat destruction, documentarian David Attenborough described humanity as a "plague upon the Earth." Meanwhile, the Bioscience paper signed by 11,000 scientists projects total societal collapse if population isn't managed properly. "I think that there's a kind of a catastrophizing, apocalyptic undercurrent," says Ted Nordhaus, founder of the Breakthrough Institute, which advocates technological solutions to environmental problems. He believes the environmental movement has long been hindered by its anti-growth paradigm. "Conventional environmental ideology posits human development and environmental protection, oppositionally, and I have exactly the opposite view," he says. Nordhaus says that the most effective way to deal with climate change is by promoting policies that accelerate economic growth. And so Nordhaus advocates for greater reliance on clean, abundant energy like nuclear power to fuel advanced economies towards possibly innovating even lower impact alternatives.¬† But the third-world may still need to rely on traditional fossil fuels on its path to prosperity and population stabilization.

In most cases those cycles will continue long after we're gone. A look at the history of climate change on Earth can give us some much needed perspective on our current climate dilemma because the surprising truth is, what we're experiencing now is different than anything this planet has encountered before. So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?

This is something that‚Äôs one of the biggest challenges that humanity has ever faced, and it‚Äôs something that in the next couple of decades and centuries we‚Äôre going to have to really band together and work together to solve. And when you ask a question like you did, about ‚Äúhow might you solve climate change,‚Äù it actually gives me a lot of hope because it means that young people like you are really starting to think about ideas about how we could address climate change. You said, ‚Äúcould you build a giant disk and put it between the earth and the sun and have it act as a kind of sunshade actually cooling down the earth?‚Äù That‚Äôs a wonderful idea. There are some things about that that would be quite difficult and one thing is that the sun is actually very large, it‚Äôs much larger than the earth, so it actually projects light around anything that you put up there. You‚Äôd have to put a very, very large disk up there. It might have to be something roughly the size of the planet in order to shade the planet effectively against the sun. So that‚Äôs something that might be possible, but it would be very expensive and difficult to construct. But I love the fact that you‚Äôre thinking about it. It does however to me sort of not address the underlying problems with climate change. A lot of people have ideas similar to yours that, what if we could just block out some of the sun‚Äôs light, would that actually make climate change go away? And one of the ideas people have is possibly launching lots and lots of particles of dust up into the atmosphere. We observed that when there‚Äôs a volcanic explosion and the earth naturally puts lots and lots of dust up into the atmosphere, the earth‚Äôs climate cools. We observed this in the ‚Äò90s when Mount Pinatubo erupted and we actually had a decline, a little bit of a notch on the global warming, just due to this volcano putting lots and lots of stuff up into the atmosphere. So could we do that artificially could we just darken our atmosphere to actually have less sunlight get through? The answer is yes, we probably could, but it would be a huge effort. A single volcano puts up many, many thousands of tons of dust up there, so this would have to be something continuous: lots and lots of rockets or aircraft distributing dust across the atmosphere. And the thing that kind of frightens me is that we really don't understand our atmosphere enough to know what that sort of cooling would do. The atmosphere stores heat, it creates winds and of course the air moves around, there are storms; scientists spend a lot of time studying how the atmosphere stores heat, how the weather forms, and when you darken the atmosphere I‚Äôm not sure what it would do to our weather. It would be a very dangerous experiment to do if you couldn‚Äôt control it. And the same thing with building a disk: I‚Äôm not sure that darkening the earth is a very good idea; it may change things like weather patterns or even ocean currents, the winds, all of that. It also doesn‚Äôt get at the problem of carbon dioxide. Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer and warmer and warmer is because we humans are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere and this acts as what we call a greenhouse gas. Sunlight can get through the atmosphere but the carbon dioxide traps it and it can‚Äôt release itself back into space so it gets warmer and warmer over time. Carbon dio...

Nine years ago, while in retirement, he found reliable data suggesting that volcanic eruptions not only cool the earth for a few years, something that is well known, but also can warm the earth substantially. How could this be? Realizing the importance of figuring this out, he set off on a full-time quest trying to understand in detail how volcanism has controlled climate throughout Earth history, throughout the evolution of our species, throughout written history, and why 2015 is the hottest year on record.

How could spraying chemicals into the stratosphere help counteract global warming? Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 What if you discovered a way to cool down the planet? Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more ferocious. As the surface temperature of earth continues to rise, so too will the ferocity of natural disasters. In 2018 scientists will take bold steps to explore a technology that could reverse the effects of climate-change. They‚Äôre looking at ways to reflect sunlight back into space and cool down the planet. Insurers say the number of weather-related disasters has quadrupled since 1970. While world leaders are debating and disputing climate-change and the ways in which humans alter their behaviour on earth, some scientists discuss changes to the earth itself. In 2018, they‚Äôll take to the stratosphere to learn what it might take ‚Äì or cost ‚Äì to cool the planet directly. Geoengineering is the pioneering science that could well be on everyone‚Äôs lips in 2018. The team from Harvard University is the first in the world to test the effects solar geoengineering might have in the stratosphere. The experiments in 2018 won‚Äôt impact the climate, but if one day implemented, this controversial intervention could help curb extreme weather events. Solar geoengineering has the potential to save lives, but it also poses unknown risks. And there are fears that merely researching geoengineering might be detrimental to the long-term fight against climate-change. Some environmentalists say that the drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions could be lost if there‚Äôs seen to be a quick fix. And deciding who controls a technology that affects everyone on the planet won‚Äôt be easy. Ultimately solar geoengineering could prove a risk not worth taking. But ignoring it now could be even more dangerous. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) Global emissions have risen by 1.5% per year in the last decade, which could mean a temperature rise of 3.2 celsius by the end of this century. Richer countries, says the report, have failed to cut emissions quickly enough. And nations must increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five fold if the world is to meet current pledged targets Here, the impact of climate change is raising concerns at one of the UK's most significant wildlife reserves. The Farne Islands off the Northumberland coast, are a major colony for seabirds and grey seals. But dramatic population changes in recent years have led to calls for more action. ----------------------- Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Channel4News	25	News & Politics	PT6M8S	368	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KzjiNDbGZPM/maxresdefault.jpg		4799	122	43	0	284

New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.	28	Science & Technology	PT2M31S	151	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS0ZIUtsQHg/maxresdefault.jpg		23184	203	29	0	56

But it can be difficult to know what your role is in this process‚Äìand you may even wonder whether you can make a difference at all. Does what you do as an entry-level employee or a small business owner really matter? Can we get where the science tells us we need to be within capitalism? And is it worth being optimistic when the planet seems doomed? Andrew Winston, the author of the Big Idea article ‚ÄúLeading a New Era of Climate Action,‚Äù https://hbr.org/cover-story/2020/01/leading-a-new-era-of-climate-action, can help.

Motion to be debated today ‚ÄòThat this House declares an environment and climate emergency following the finding of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change that to avoid a more than 1.5¬∞C rise in global warming, global emissions would need to fall by around 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero by around 2050; recognises the devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on UK food production, water availability, public health and through flooding and wildfire damage; notes that the UK is currently missing almost all of its biodiversity targets, with an alarming trend in species decline, and that cuts of 50 per cent to the funding of Natural England are counterproductive to tackling those problems; calls on the Government to increase the ambition of the UK‚Äôs climate change targets under the Climate Change Act 2008 to achieve net zero emissions before 2050, to increase support for and set ambitious, short-term targets for the roll-out of renewable and low carbon energy and transport, and to move swiftly to capture economic opportunities and green jobs in the low carbon economy while managing risks for workers and communities currently reliant on carbon intensive sectors; and further calls on the Government to lay before the House within the next six months urgent proposals to restore the UK‚Äôs natural environment and to deliver a circular, zero waste economy.‚Äô What is an Opposition day? Usually the Government decides what is debated in the Chamber but twenty days in each session are set aside for debates on subjects chosen by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition (currently Jeremy Corbyn, Labour) gets 17 days. The other three days are allocated to the third largest party in the House (currently The Scottish National Party). Parliamentary sessions usually last for a year but if a session lasts longer than a year, the whips may agree on a further number of Opposition days. And the Government may provide further ‚Äòunallotted‚Äô Opposition days, even in a normal year-long session. Some of these might be used for the smaller political parties to choose the subject for debate. The Opposition sometimes table a motion in the form of a humble address on Opposition days. A humble address is a message to the Queen. It‚Äôs used, among other things to call for papers from departments headed by a Secretary of State.	25	News & Politics	PT5H23M8S	1388	2d	sd	false			18842	332	64	0	139

Climate change is one of the most intensively studied phenomena in the world today. This video offers a brief summary of the direction of Earth's climate today. Researchers have documented changes in a range of areas, including land, atmospheric and ocean temperatures, glacial melting, shrinking sea ice, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, increased water vapor and more. It's hard, given what we know and what many people around the world have experienced, that climate change is already a distressing reality.	28	Science & Technology	PT5M18S	318	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nZIOZwUPNnA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	32485	993	346	0	1417

As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.‚Äù He was speaking before the US Congress to confront the defining issue of his time ‚Äì slavery. Everyone knew it had to end but no one had the political will to stop it. Remarkably, his words ring as true today when applied to the defining crisis of our time ‚Äì Climate Change. As a UN Messenger of Peace, I have traveled all over the world for the last two years documenting how this crisis is changing the natural balance of our planet. I have seen cities like Beijing choked by industrial pollution. Ancient Boreal forests in Canada that have been clear cut and rainforests in Indonesia that have been incinerated. In India, I met farmers whose crops have literally been washed away by historic flooding. In America, I have witnessed unprecedented droughts in California and sea level rise flooding the streets of Miami. In Greenland and in the Arctic I was astonished to see that ancient glaciers are rapidly disappearing well ahead of scientific predictions. All that I have seen and learned on this journey has absolutely terrified me. There is no doubt in the world‚Äôs scientific community that this a direct result of human activity and that the effects of climate change will become astronomically worse in the future. You know that climate change is happening faster than even the most pessimistic of scientists warned us decades ago. It has become a runaway freight train bringing with it an impending disaster for all living things. Now think about the shame that each of us will carry when our children and grandchildren look back and realize that we had the means of stopping this devastation, but simply lacked the political will to do so. Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Massive change is required, now. One that leads to a new collective consciousness. A new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you. We all know that reversing the course of climate change will not be easy, but the tools are in our hands ‚Äì if we apply them before it is too late. Now is the time for bold unprecedented action. It is time to ask each other ‚Äì which side of history will you be on? As a citizen of our planet, it is time to declare no more talk. No more excuses. No more ten-year studies. No more allowing the fossil fuel companies to manipulate and dictate the science and policies that affect our future. Lincoln‚Äôs words still resonate to all of us here today:‚ÄúWe will be remembered in spite of ourselves. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation‚Ä¶ We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.‚Äù That is our charge now ‚Äì you are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it. Or we ‚Äì and all living things we cherish ‚Äì are history." - Leonardo DiCaprio ‚ñ∫ For more Inspirational Videos: http://blog.goalcast.life/epic-motivational-videos/ ‚ñ∫ Subscribe To Our Channel Here: https://goo.gl/wTKGC4 Don't forget to share this video to spread the inspiration! ========================================¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠======== FOLLOW US: Facebook: https://goo.gl/cjShXM Instagram: https://goo.gl/XaukHK Twitter: https://goo.gl/WBe30b Website: http://www.goalcast.life ========================================¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠========	24	Entertainment	PT3M53S	233	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F47RIF_0reA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	146948	2368	60	0	152

I talk about the game's mechanics, the frequency of extreme weather events, and the knock-on effects on human behaviour in the game. In short, the game does a very good job, way beyond a crude depiction of global warming. Thanks to 2K and Firaxis for providing early access to the game! (1) See http://www.trillionthtonne.org/questions.html (2) As ever, SkepticalScience has your back: https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html (3) For a cool interactive report about how hurricanes have changed with anthropogenic climate change, see https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/changes-hurricanes (4) Note here that I'm talking about the mean 'waviness' of the jet stream, leading to more frequent and more intense outbreaks of Arctic air. The recent cold outbreak over North America was likely exacerbated by this effect, but not caused by it - the root cause was a SSW, which current science indicates was not made more likely due to climate change. (5) See e.g. http://oxfordre.com/climatescience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228620-e-344 (6) Natural variability in the atmosphere is something of a politicized and so thorny topic. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hockey_Stick_and_the_Climate_Wars for an idea of why I didn't want to delve into this in detail. There are a few things which I didn't mention in the video because I recorded it in a great hurry. Here are three of them. Firstly the game only specifically addresses CO2 emissions rather than a multitude of gases such as methane - this is technically inaccurate but I can understand why they simplified it. Secondly I didn't talk about any quantitative aspects of X emissions equating to Y warming or Z sea ice loss as that would require a standardised unit of emissions in the game, which it doesn't provide! Besides, there's no reason to believe that all other geophysical parameters would be the same as our Earth, making any kind of quantitative analysis difficult at best (and, to be honest, not that interesting!). Lastly, arguably the most unrealistic part of the game is that all world leaders in it believe that climate change is a significant issue!

A leading climate scientist helps sort fact from fiction and stresses the importance of adapting to an uncertain future. Linda Mortsch has devoted her career to addressing climate change issues. Since 1989, she has played a role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and is a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1992, her research project ‚ÄúAdapting to climate variability and change in the Great Lakes Basin‚Äù was one of the first to explore adaptation to climate change in Canada. Today, Linda has an adjunct appointment in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, and has been recognized by a number of associations, including the International Joint Commission, American Geophysical Union, Environment Canada, and more. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Climate change is THE existential question that humanity is facing. But are we too late? Has climate change reached the point of no return? Are we doomed? TEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. ABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess. *NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY* SUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above. Follow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoise **What‚Äôs the state of climate change right now?** Since around 1880, the average global temperature of the earth has increased by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That increase is due almost entirely to humans burning fossil fuels, mostly from 1950 on. That might not sound like a big increase, but it is. It means sea level rise, shrinking polar ice caps, and increased extreme weather events like heat waves and monsoons. That‚Äôs why a hundred and ninety-plus countries signed onto the Paris Climate Agreement. The goal is to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- by the end of this century. Many scientists say that staying under 1.5 puts us near the upper limit of what's tolerable. We‚Äôll have droughts, sea level rise, and extreme weather, but chances are we can manage it. **What does climate change look like in the future?** That‚Äôs why we have the IPCC. The IPCC is part of the United Nations, and it stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It‚Äôs been the world‚Äôs top authority on climate science for the last 30 years. Thousands of climate scientists from around the world volunteer their time to analyze and summarize the latest and best climate science. According to these experts, if we keep burning fossil fuels like we are today, then we‚Äôre blowing past 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100. We‚Äôll almost definitely hit 2 degrees, and might even reach 3 or even 4 degrees. That means longer and more intense heat waves. And stronger hurricanes and dangerous flooding. **How do we get climate change under control?** Let‚Äôs start with transportation. 95% of the vehicles on the planet burn fossil fuels. They‚Äôre responsible for almost ‚Öì of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide! It might sound like a pipe-dream to replace those gas-guzzlers with electric vehicles, but it might not be. In the last decade and a half electric vehicles that don't have any pollution out of the tailpipe went from a dream to commonplace in places like California, China, Norway. Then we have the energy sector -- think power plants. In 2016, 80% of the world‚Äôs energy came from fossil fuels, while only 5% came from renewables like solar and wind. But we‚Äôre seeing that change. Now solar is the cheapest form of energy in just two decades. That‚Äôs a huge change. And then there‚Äôs how we use land. We‚Äôre cutting down WAY too many trees and using a lot of that land to raise livestock that we end up eating. The United Nations estimates that if the world stopped getting food from animal sources, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by one-fourth. SOURCES: Climate Change: How Do We Know?

Moreover, the impacts associated with 2¬∞C have been revised upward sufficiently so that 2¬∞C now more appropriately represents the threshold between 'dangerous' and 'extremely dangerous' climate change. Kevin Anderson will address the endemic bias prevalent amongst many of those building emission scenarios to underplay the scale of the 2¬∞C challenge. In several respects, the modeling community is actually self-censoring its research to conform to the dominant political and economic paradigm. However, even a slim chance of 'keeping below' a 2¬∞C rise now demands a revolution in how we consume and produce energy. Such a rapid and deep transition will have profound implications for the framing of society, and is far removed from the rhetoric of green growth that increasingly dominates the climate change agenda.

Over and over again. And far too many leaders have refused to listen. And far too few have acted with the vision the science demands.‚Äù He said noted that ‚Äúas climate change intensifies, we will find it harder to feed ourselves‚Äù causing ‚Äúmore and more people will be forced to migrate from their homes as the land they depend on becomes less able to support them.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúthis is already leading to local conflicts over dwindling resources.‚Äù Guterres called on governments, businesses, scientists and that will put the planet on a path to a better future. He said ‚Äúthe commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. The mountain in front of us is very high. But it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.‚Äù Guterres also outlined his vision for a new Climate Summit in 2019, which he will be convening to rally the international community, to step up action in key areas inclusive sustainable energy production, economic growth, green investment and better stewardship of natural resources. He said, ‚Äúenormous benefits await humankind if we can rise to the climate challenge‚Äù and added that the argument that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth ‚Äúis hogwash.‚Äù In fact, he said ‚Äúthe opposite is true.‚Äù The call for greater ambition on climate action comes amid record temperature rises and extreme weather events across the globe. The last few months alone saw devastating floods in southern India, wildfires in the United States and extreme heatwaves in Japan. Guterres said, ‚Äúwe stand at an existential crossroad. If we are to take the right path ‚Äì the only sensible path -- we will have to muster the full force of human ingenuity‚Äù and stressed that ‚Äútechnology is on our side in the battle to address climate change.‚Äù He pointed out that ‚Äúthe transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up‚Äù and said that infrastructure investment must be ‚Äúsustainable or we will lock in a high-polluting dangerous future.‚Äù Guterres said ‚Äúevery day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our own hands. The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù When world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, they pledged to stop temperatures rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees, as possible. But scientists and a major UN study, indicate that the target is already well off-track. The UN chief‚Äôs message also comes ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held on the west coast of the United States, in San Francisco, from 12-14 September. National, regional and municipal leaders will gather with business people and philanthropic communities to underscore their commitment to climate action.	25	News & Politics	PT28M2S	1682	2d	sd	false			27225	453	69	0	221

The difference was so drastic in her opinion that she decided to take matters into her own hands. Greta is a 15-year-old Stockholm native who lives at home with her parents and sister Beata.

LEARN MORE: https://abcn.ws/2LVUihY Mont Blanc, the tallest mountain in Europe, located in the Alps between Italy and France, has become a symbol of climate change as its glaciers continue to rapidly melt in response to the warming of the Earth. As the ice melts and falls, it creates a dangerous hazard for both locals and the millions of tourists who visit the site annually while also drying up fresh water supplies, said Fabrizio Troilo, a geologist for the Safe Mountain Foundation, an Italian-based organization. #ABCNews #MontBlanc #Alps #ClimateChange	25	News & Politics	PT4M6S	246	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/p05YJ5if8Ew/maxresdefault.jpg	1	14282	237	62	0	240

A lecture by Chris Budd OBE, Gresham Professor of Geometry 13 November 2018 https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/mathematics-climate-change Climate change is important, controversial, and the subject of huge debate. Much of our understanding of the future climate comes from the use of complex climate models based on mathematical and physical ideas. In this talk, Professor Budd will describe how these models work and the assumptions that go into them. He will discuss how reliable our predictions of climate change are, and show how mathematicians can give us insights into both past and future.

Will climate change lead to the next financial crisis? A report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) also known as the central bank of central banks says that climate change can lead to a ‚Äúgreen swan‚Äù. These are potentially extremely financially disruptive events which could be behind the next systemic financial crisis. However integrating climate-risk analysis into financial stability monitoring and supervision Is challenging because of varied climate change impacts and mitigation strategies. It says that current models of climate predictions are inadequate and requires "a second epistemological break". Central banks need to coordinate their own actions with a broad set of measures to be implemented by other players like governments, industries and civil societies. It says Financial and climate stability are interconnected public goods and this consideration can be extend to other problems such as the loss of biodiversity.	28	Science & Technology	PT1M44S	104	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Av9SW1yw5lg/maxresdefault.jpg		783	48	0	0	2

U.S. President Donald Trump and Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg had two very different messages to give over climate change. Our Park Hee-jun has more. Two of the most high-profile attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos ensured it was impossible to miss the annual meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump and teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg,... carried on their indirect debate on climate change. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, local time,... President Trump revealed that the U.S. will join the initiative to plant one trillion trees. "Today, I'm pleased to announce the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. One trillion trees." While this year's forum is focused on how businesses must change to save the planet,... President Trump's more than 30-minute long speech was devoted to highlighting the importance of the oil and gas industries,... with promises on climate change nowhere to be found. Instead, he warned against listening to the "prophets of doom." "This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism in action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse." Sitting in the audience for the speech was Thunberg. Speaking shortly after President Trump's special address, the Swedish activist took aim at Trump and other world leaders, accusing them of doing nothing and making empty promises on climate change. "You say children shouldn't worry. You say just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic. And then, nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence. Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken." She also criticized the lack of action to reduce carbon emissions when the world is in her words "on fire". "I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions, without even trying? Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour." Their mutual dislike of each other has been in the spotlight since last year. Their last encounter was at the UN last September. Photos and videos of Thunberg glaring at President Trump as he passed by after the climate change summit went viral at the time. It was followed by a tweet by the American leader, saying Thunberg should work on her anger management issues.

Sea temperatures in 2019 were the highest on record. Oceans are the clearest measure of climate change, since they absorb 90 per cent of the world's heat. Warmer seas mean more intense storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. The study is the latest warning on the climate crisis facing our planet. However, greenhouse gas emissions are still at record levels. Are we starting to tune out to the constant stream of bad news on the climate? If so, how should we change the conversation?

Which isn‚Äôt really fair, for the most part most humans aren‚Äôt actually contributing that heavily to climate change, you dear viewer sitting behind a computer or a phone screen may be one of the larger contributors just by virtue of being a wealthier more consumptive human, but a vast majority of the worlds population lives very simple lives, and almost ironically these less wealthy world citizens are likely to be the ones most heavily impacted by the potential side effects of climate change. In this video we will explore the economic impacts of climate change both in terms of its potential consequences and the feasibility of the solutions.

Animated film. Length: 5'42" The impacts of climate change destroy people's livelihoods and homes. They damage our infrastructure and disrupt communication and trade. Moreover, climate change is endangering development successes and the poor and marginalized are often affected the most. Even if we were to stop emissions instantly, the world would not stop warming immediately due to the amount of gases we have already emitted. That's why we must do both: reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to inevitable climate change. But how can we adapt, considering that the precise extent and form of climate change aren't known?

But with climate skeptics (and their allies in industry and government) thwarting conservationists‚Äô efforts, some scientists are working to develop a back-up plan: using technology to ‚Äúgeoengineer‚Äù the Earth's atmosphere and reduce the impacts of climate change. But geoengineering is seen by some as a distraction from the real challenge of climate change in much of the scientific community. Critics say it's a solution that diverts attention away from the real challenge, which is finding a way for the world to drastically reduce the amount of man-made carbon that its pumping into the atmosphere. Shane Smith and Ben Anderson took an in-depth look at how this technology would work ‚Äî and how effective this radical (and potentially dangerous) plan could be.

Will Exclude from Its Next Climate Report	"Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science" -- produced by a team of 40 scientists -- is the newest volume in the Climate Change Reconsidered series produced by The Heartland Institute and members of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). As in previous reports, thousands of peer-reviewed articles are cited to determine the current state-of-the-art of climate science. This newest volume's findings challenge the alarmist reports of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose next report is due out later this month. NIPCC authors paid special attention to contributions that were overlooked by the IPCC or that presented data, discussion, or implications, arguing against the IPCC's claim that dangerous global warming is occurring, or will occur, from human-related greenhouse gas emissions.	25	News & Politics	PT58M17S	3497	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jaVL1Ham-4A/maxresdefault.jpg		111973	2624	124	0	1536

And these shifting weather patterns will especially impact our food supply. One beloved crop, the grape, is already facing threats due to its extreme sensitivity. In turn, that threatens the grape's main byproduct: wine. In the vineyards of Napa during historic wildfires and the wine laboratories of Bordeaux, Gianna Toboni explores the dangers facing viticulture, and what they mean for agriculture everywhere.

This is in addition to the billion or so currently at risk. Several new studies are just being completed of the potential effects of climate change on global food production potential, and there is a convergence of evidence about the scale and regional distribution of the challenge: Most of the additional climate-change driven hunger will be in the least developed parts of Africa, but significant numbers could also occur in south and south-east Asia. In all regions, the poor, young and elderly are likely to be most affected. International negotiations as part of the UNFCCC have set a very ambitious spending target of about $50bn per annum to be available for adaptation for all sectors and, assuming that a significant part of this is spent on agriculture, the impacts of climate change can probably be substantially reduced. But it is unlikely that major effects can be avoided for current trends in economic development. Only a major reduction in incidence of poverty would avoid significant damage. This requires a transformation in development effort. For more information please visit http://www.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange	28	Science & Technology	PT1H4M26S	266	2d	sd	false			13925	41	6	0	2

At 11am on Monday, protesters set up camps and roadblocks at Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Piccadilly Circus. The roadblocks are planned to continue around the clock for at least a week in a protest reminiscent of the Occupy London camp outside St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral in 2011-12.

As might the courses on Brilliant: http://brilliant.org/simonclark Recently the media has been abuzz with talk of the 'polar vortex' which they describe as being an outbreak of cold air over the United States and Canada. In this video I break down what the polar vortex is and isn't, talk about why it's suddenly so extremely cold, and ask whether this weather was caused by climate change. I'd like to stress that this video is specifically looking at a) what the polar vortex exactly is, and b) whether the vortex is experiencing sudden warmings more frequently under climate change. There are however, as I hint in the video, multiple factors forcing all events in the atmosphere, including the current cold snap. The jet stream is ultimately the main mechanism (as forced by the sudden warming) and the effect of climate change on the jet stream itself is still debated. See for example this thread from Dr Amy Butler: https://twitter.com/DrAHButler/status/1091048568452988929. The conclusion that I draw on this video is perhaps phrased too generally - in my opinion the SSW, which was a significant factor in the current cold snap, was not made more likely by climate change. There of course remains the possibility that other forcing factors, such as the long-term average strength of the jet stream, *were* altered by climate change to make the cold snap more likely. Again this is just my personal opinion, and I encourage informed debate in the comments! REFERENCES: (1) Wind on 10hPa surface. Created using the excellent http://earth.nullschool.net (2) I will concede that there is a certain degree of ambiguity in the literature about the term 'polar vortex', with some referring to the low pressure system in the stratosphere using the term. Most however use the term to refer to the circulation itself, sometimes also called the polar night jet. It is however NOT a surface or even tropospheric phenomenon. (3) See Butler et al, 2017 https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/9/63/2017/essd-9-63-2017.pdf (4) My PhD thesis: https://www.simonoxfphys.com/blog/2018/10/15/my-phd-thesis (5) Baldwin (my PhD supervisor) and Dunkerton, 2001: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5542/581.full (6) See, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_wind (7) Temperature anomalies, 1880-2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGOzHVUQCw0 (8) Ayarzag√ºena et al, 2018: https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/18/11277/2018/acp-18-11277-2018.pdf (9) As I say in my interjection, there is evidence to suggest that the jet stream is meandering more due to a warmer Arctic, though that's not the focus of this video. Remember that for simplicity I'm only focusing on the influence of the SSW! See e.g. Francis and Vavrus, 2015. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/1/014005/pdf (10) Graphs from http://www.theclimateconsensus.com/content/satellite-data-show-a-cooling-trend-in-the-upper-atmosphere-so-much-for-global-warming-right (11) Note that I'm not saying stratospheric cooling is why tropospheric warming is not affecting the vortex! I'm simply using this as an example of how two contributing factors to the dynamics can be forced in opposite directions by climate change.

What is a zombie theory? Says Shepherd: "It's one of those theories that scientists have refuted or disproven time and time again, but they live on like zombies in the blogs and on the radio stations." About This Speaker As the 2013 president of the American Meteorological Society, Shepherd is a leading international expert in weather, climate and atmospheric sciences, and recently briefed the U.S. Senate on climate and extreme weather. A professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia, Shepherd is director of the University's Atmospheric Sciences Program. Shepherd spent 12 years as a research meteorologist in the Earth-Sun Division at NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center. Shepherd was recently named the UGA Athletic Association Professor in Geography and 2004 was honored at the White House by President Bush with a PECASE award as one of the top young scientists and engineers in the country.

You don't care about climate change right? Because it's a bunch words of things that don't affect your daily life. Think again. In this provocative talk, Saddington gives us a new lens on climate change. It's a game changer. Influencing UK government policy, establishing his own social enterprise and fronting a media campaign that reached over 3 million people are just a few of David‚Äôs achievements as a climate change activist since being impacted by a stark reminder of climate change as a teenager. From a meeting with then Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street, he discussed the implementation of climate change on the national curriculum. Climate change is now an essential part of youth education and he has pushed to expand these education reforms worldwide. As a Three Dot Dash Global Teen Leader, he has expanded his philanthropic and award-winning social enterprise, which has developed eco gardens across Northern England and within the historic grounds of Durham University. David has acted as an environmental consultant for countless organisations and is a regular commentator on contemporary climate issues within academic arenas and international media outlets. He has studied the science of climate change at Durham University for 3 years and led a groundbreaking glacier survey expedition to Vatnaj√∂kull, Iceland. His most recent venture transformed the medieval Market Square of Durham City into an outdoor cinema to showcase the award-winning documentary Chasing Ice. He then chaired ‚ÄòClimate Change Question Time,‚Äô where the public could grill world leading climate experts on the science behind the headlines and how to tackle the problem. David believes that we must act as a species rather than via fragmented interests in order to tackle this remarkable global disruptor.

At the same time, it is a threat to humanity‚Äôs future. Climate action (CA) means giving up some material benefits now in order to reduce future climate damages. Timo Goeschl is a professor of economics and in this talk, he investigates, through economic experiments, the factors that determine people‚Äôs willingness to engage in voluntary CA (VCA). In the experiments, people take a decision: Receive cash ‚Äì or reduce the emissions of climate changing gases. The important thing is: Both options are for real. So, how do people decide? And what determines how people choose? Identifying these factors gives Timo Goeschl hope to 'get VCA going' and shows that we have a role in nurturing VCA ourselves. Timo Goeschl is professor of Environmental Economics in the Department of Economics at Heidelberg University and director of the Research Center for Environmental Economics as well as research associate of the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) in Mannheim. Timo is co-editor of the journal Environmental & Resource Economics and, over the years, has advised the World Bank, the OECD, the International Maritime Organization, the UK‚Äôs Prime Minister‚Äôs Strategy Unit, the Environment Agency for England and Wales, and the German Parliament (Bundestag), among others.

Unfortunately, coasts are also particularly vulnerable to climate hazards and weather events. Particular vulnerabilities include loss of land and islands from sea level rise and loss of homes and lives from extreme weather events such as cyclones. The resulting impacts ‚Äì coastal erosion, infrastructure damage, flooding and salt water intrusion ‚Äì present a critical challenge to many Pacific island coastlines. Supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) programme is the first major climate change adaptation initiative in the Pacific region. Since it began in 2009 the programme has laid the groundwork for more resilient Pacific communities that can cope with climate variability today, and climate change tomorrow. This short video, narrated by renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, highlights the PACC projects that are working to reduce the vulnerability of island coasts.

The talk will highlight the impact major ‚Äònatural‚Äô changes in global climate have had on the five largest mass extinctions over the last 500 million years, and will explain modelling of recent CO2 emissions and concentrations which confirm the impact of human activity, with a focus on UK CO2 emissions over the period 1860 - 2016. The role of major policy interventions which have reduced the UK‚Äôs per capita annual emissions below any level since 1860 when the UK was the 'workshop of the world‚Äô will be investigated. Professor Sir David Hendry, INET Oxford and Climate Econometrics, will illustrate how to investigate the costs of ‚Äòmis-forecasting‚Äô extreme climate events by studying the economic impacts of inaccuracies in hurricane forecasts and will discuss empirical evidence on local climate impacts of emissions and what influences climate-change scepticism.

According to Chomsky, this massive public relations campaign has succeeded in leading a good portion of the population into doubting the human causes of global warming. Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. "Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow," Chomsky says. "What do they have to say any more than your barber?" All this is part of the media's pursuit of "fabled objectivity." Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of "pointy-headed elitists." The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a "death knell for the species" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. "If this was happening in some small country," Chomsky concludes, "it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species."

However, there‚Äôs also a deluge of misinformation designed to confuse the public and generate doubt about climate change. How should we respond to the firehose of falsehoods? One way to neutralize the influence of misinformation is through inoculation. This takes the idea of vaccination and applies it to knowledge‚Äîwe can build immunity to misinformation by exposing people to a weak form of misinformation. In other words, by explaining the reasoning fallacies in denialist claims‚Äîexposing the techniques used to mislead. Not only does this approach neutralize the influence of science denial, it can turn misinformation into an educational opportunity and improve critical thinking. This talk will outline the research into countering misinformation and demonstrate the approach with visual examples. The Center for Inquiry is a 501(c)(3) charitable nonprofit organization. CFI‚Äôs vision is a world in which evidence, science, and compassion‚Äîrather than superstition, pseudoscience, or prejudice‚Äîguide public policy. You can join CFI and find out what we do to protect critical thinking and science by visiting: https://centerforinquiry.org This talk took place at the CSICon 2018 in Las Vegas on October 20, 2018 John Cook is a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University. His research focus is understanding and countering misinformation about climate change. In 2007, he founded Skeptical Science, a website which won the 2011 Australian Museum Eureka Prize for the Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge and 2016 Friend of the Planet Award from the National Center for Science Education. John co-authored the college textbooks Climate Change: Examining the Facts and Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis and the book Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. In 2013, he published a paper finding 97% scientific consensus on human-caused global warming, a finding that has been highlighted by President Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron.	27	Education	PT28M1S	1681	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/X7Wv0AZC_D4/maxresdefault.jpg		11461	171	149	0	224

We now know these gases have changed the climate. But since the mid-2000s, an interesting shift has occurred. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions are now coming from large developing countries, who are looking for cheap energy sources to drive their own economic growth, just like rich countries before them.

I have moved three times, every three years I have moved, he said, standing on the beach a few metres from his home. Tioram gestured toward a point about 20 metres into the sea, and explained that his first house once stood on a spot now covered in swelling ocean waves. Each time he has moved farther inland, and each time the sea has followed. Im not sure how long Ill be [in this house], Tioram continued. That depends on how strong my seawall here can withstand high tide waves. UNDP believes that it is the developing world that stands to lose the most, and which is already losing out, as the effects of climate change edge toward the catastrophic. As climate negotiations open in Copenhagen, worlds away from this tiny Pacific nation consisting of 33 low lying atolls, it is important to keep in mind that for the people of Kirabati, and other poor island and coastal nations, funds for adaptation and not only prevention must top the international to-do list. Carbon trading will be of no special consequence to us, so there has got to be some very special provisions for the victims, said Kirabati President Anote Tong. Not the potential victims, but the victims, because we are the victims, so there has to be some very deep soul searching. Kirabati is no more than four metres high at its highest point, and 100 percent of the population lives within one kilometre of the coast, making this nation one of the most vulnerable to the effects of global warming. Its future is uncertain, including the question of whether it even has a future anymore. The scientific research shows that by 2100 its almost certain that well have more than a metre of sea level rise, said Karen Bernard, a UNDP programme specialist in natural disaster reduction and transition. On a flat island like Kirabati that mount of sea level rise comes very far inland. Its a very serious situation, Bernard continued. For that reason, the Government is looking for options for relocating the population.	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT6M32S	392	2d	sd	false			838331	1998	429	0	1085

Are organic farming and hydroponics the key to farming's future? SUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/kdDpXu Unpredictable weather patterns are forcing farmers to adopt new methods to maintain a viable business while making food production as efficient as possible. A small farm in south Dakota has turned to organic farming and invested in their dirt while others have taken climate out of the equation and invested in hydroponics, growing vegetables in large warehouses. In the last of our What Happens Next, we explore the future of food through farming.

By 2050, the increase in temperature alone is projected to cause a 20% reduction in the yield of all of the major grains (maize, wheat, rice and soybeans). The breadbasket countries in the midlatitudes will experience marked increases in year-to-year volatility in crop production. Increasing stresses on the major crops due to climate change, coupled with the increasing demand for food due to increasing population and development, present significant challenges to achieving global food security. This seminar explores the likely impact of climate change and volatility on food production and availability in the foreseeable future.	10	Music	PT1H5M58S	358	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/06ZkcOqT76M/maxresdefault.jpg		20198	195	8	0	116

It‚Äôs a predicament Bill Nye can lend some guidance on; science skeptics and climate change deniers have been one of his longest uphill battles in the public sphere. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BILL NYE Bill Nye, scientist, engineer, comedian, author, and inventor, is a man with a mission: to help foster a scientifically literate society, to help people everywhere understand and appreciate the science that makes our world work. Making science entertaining and accessible is something Bill has been doing most of his life. In Seattle Nye began to combine his love of science with his flair for comedy, when he won the Steve Martin look-alike contest and developed dual careers as an engineer by day and a stand-up comic by night. Nye then quit his day engineering day job and made the transition to a night job as a comedy writer and performer on Seattle‚Äôs home-grown ensemble comedy show ‚ÄúAlmost Live.‚Äù This is where ‚ÄúBill Nye the Science Guy¬Æ‚Äù was born. The show appeared before Saturday Night Live and later on Comedy Central, originating at KING-TV, Seattle‚Äôs NBC affiliate. While working on the Science Guy show, Nye won seven national Emmy Awards for writing, performing, and producing. The show won 18 Emmys in five years. In between creating the shows, he wrote five children‚Äôs books about science, including his latest title, ‚ÄúBill Nye‚Äôs Great Big Book of Tiny Germs.‚Äù Nye is the host of three currently-running television series. ‚ÄúThe 100 Greatest Discoveries‚Äù airs on the Science Channel. ‚ÄúThe Eyes of Nye‚Äù airs on PBS stations across the country. Bill‚Äôs latest project is hosting a show on Planet Green called ‚ÄúStuff Happens.‚Äù It‚Äôs about environmentally responsible choices that consumers can make as they go about their day and their shopping. Also, you‚Äôll see Nye in his good-natured rivalry with his neighbor Ed Begley. They compete to see who can save the most energy and produce the smallest carbon footprint. Nye has 4,000 watts of solar power and a solar-boosted hot water system. There‚Äôs also the low water use garden and underground watering system. It‚Äôs fun for him; he‚Äôs an engineer with an energy conservation hobby. Nye is currently the Executive Director of The Planetary Society, the world‚Äôs largest space interest organization. ¬† ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: Danny Miller: Hello Bill. My name is Danny Miller. Politically I tend to be conservative. I believe that anthropogenic global warming is real and that the Big Bang Theory and evolution are perfectly valid theories. Obviously this puts me at odds with most people in my demographic and I find that conversations with my peers on these topics usually develop into arguments on some other random subject entirely. My question to you is why are these topics so politically charged in the matters of science and not politics and how do I engage into meaningful conversation? Thank you for answering. Bill Nye: Danny. Danny. Danny. You have touched on a subject that I find fascinating and I've spent a lot of time on myself so I'm really glad you asked this. But when it comes to anthropogenic global climate change, or human caused global climate change, it's politicized because of the fossil fuel industry. And I've spent a lot of time with this, I've asked myself as a native of the United States. I have an engineering agree in the United States; I've got my license and I practice - I'm an engineer in the United States. Why is the United States not of the world leader in addressing climate change? Why isn't the United States the world leader in renewable energies, better water purification or desalinization techniques? Better ways to provide the Internet to everyone on earth? Why isn't of the U.S. leading? And I am satisfied it's because of the success of the denial community or the deniers. They have managed to introduce the idea that scientific uncertainty, plus or minus two percent about whatever it might be, is the same as plus or minus a hundred percent. There's doubt about the whole thing and that's wrong. So what to do about it? What I always remind myself, and the example I learned from or claim I learned from was what we traditionally call skeptical thought or skeptical point of view or clinical thinking, when you tell somebody who reads her or his horoscope everyday that horoscopes are false, that t...

It's here, it's happening, it's caused by humanity, and it is one of the largest problems humanity will ever face. But I believe we will face it, and we'll face it with the desperate ingenuity and bravado with which we have faced our entire history on this planet. And we will survive it, as long as we can finally freaking agree that "it" isn't a conspiracy theory made up to annoy the rich and powerful.

At 17, she received the Bavarian Environmental Award for significantly lowering the water consumption of her home town. As part of Fossil Free Berlin, she is campaigning for the city of Berlin to divest its capital reserves from the fossil fuel industry. In 2016, she funded an association and recently launched a platform for members of German pension funds to demand divestment of their pensions. Divestment fills her with hope to tackle climate change: As a pragmatic environmentalist, as a responsible parent, as a hands-on optimist. Ella carries a communication design degree and a Master of Art.

Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that Germany would double its contribution to a U.N. fund to support less developed countries to combat climate change to 4 billion euros from 2 billion euros. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country is determined to be the most "sustainable food-produced in the world," while Indian Prime Minister Modi pledged to increase the country's renewable energy capacity. Over 60 world leaders and CEOs of energy and financial companies are expected to address the United Nations conference and announce climate finance measures and transitioning from coal power.

The World Meteorological Organization says carbon emissions increased 20 percent in the past four years, which are on track to be the hottest on record. The warning coincides with world leaders meeting in New York for a major UN climate conference. And as ice sheets are melting faster than before, causing sea levels to rise by five milimetres a year. Scientists warn that even if every country meets the carbon emission cuts agreed in the Paris climate agreement in 2015, the world will still be three degrees warmer. The warnings of catastrophe have provoked millions of young people to protest world-wide. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the largest ever mass marches on climate change, says young voices must be heard - and adults must take action to protect everyone's future. Are the world's leaders listening?

It's more than just a question of magnitude--this talk will address just how long (in geological terms) increased emissions will impact the planet's temperature, rainfall, sea level, and ice coverage. What are the ethical implications and economic arguments? Speaking from decades of research, Archer and Pierrehumbert will offer their thoughts on these questions and critique the thinking of some mainstream economists on climate change.Recommended reading:Climate Change: A Catastrophe in Slow Motion; RealClimate.org; The Long Thaw: How Humans are Changing the Next 100,000 Years of Earth's Climate; The millennial atmospheric lifetime of anthropogenic CO2; and Warming Papers (soon to be released by Blackwell/Wiley Press) ‚û° Subscribe: http://bit.ly/UCHICAGOytSubscribe About #UChicago: A destination for inquiry, research, and education, the University of Chicago empowers scholars to challenge conventional thinking.

The Earth is sick and the clock is ticking. The EU works on all fronts to repair the damages and preserve the environment: air quality, waste management, protection of biodiversity... Much still needs to be done, and the EU is leading the way. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The European Parliament is pushing for more. Find out how here: https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/priorities/climate-change ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Click here to watch Greta Thunberg addressing the European Parliament committee on environment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oyw4Wo6Kng&t=55s --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Find us on social networks: On Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/europeanparliament/ On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/europeanparliament/ On Twitter: https://twitter.com/Europarl_EN On LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-parliament/ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Earth is in crisis. The frequency of natural disasters has increased. Greta Thunberg, Swedish environmental activist: Our house is falling apart. The future - as well as all that we have achieved in the past - is literally in your hands now. But it is not too late to act. Our home is getting hotter because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in our atmosphere. Scientists say if global temperatures rise by more than 2¬∞C we will face food and water shortages, extreme weather and an almost 50cm rise in ocean levels by 2050. We could also lose up to 11.5% of the species on earth. So far the EU has cut its greenhouse gas emissions to 22% below 1990 levels and is committed to reducing them at least 40% by 2030. It isn‚Äôt just carbon we‚Äôre pumping into the skies. Air pollution gases like NOx from cars kill up to 400 000 people in the EU each year. To tackle transport pollution, new EU rules have improved fuel quality and promoted cleaner engines. Modern cars and vans are more thoroughly tested for harmful pollutants. If EU air quality is improved it could prevent thousands of premature deaths every year from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Meanwhile on the ground, 2.5 billion tonnes of waste is generated in the EU each year. Much of that ends up in the oceans. 70% of that marine litter is single-use plastics like carrier bags. Every year, we use 100 billion plastic bags. Each is used for 20 minutes on average, but takes 400 years to degrade. The EU is aiming to halve the amount of plastic bags. By 2021, single use plastic like plates, cutlery, straws and cotton buds will vanish from shops in Europe. The world is also facing threats to biodiversity. Leonardo DiCaprio, American actor and environmentalist: ‚ÄòMarine scientist Jeremy Jackson led me under water in a submersible to observe the reefs off the coast of the Bahamas, and what I saw took my breath away: Not a fish in sight, covered with colourless ghost-like coral, a complete graveyard. Turtles are vital to the health of our seas. They help maintain healthy sea grass beds and transport essential nutrients to the shore. Every year, 132 000 are caught in Mediterranean fishing nets. EU funds are helping countries protect these creatures from fishing and pollution. Meanwhile, Europe‚Äôs unique natural habitats are also being preserved. 1 500 animal and plant species are protected by the EU. Among them, the bees, whose populations are threatened and whose disappearance could have dramatic consequences: 76% of food production in Europe relies on insect pollination! The European Parliament has called for a ban on bee-killing pesticides. All of this environmental protection will be part of the European Green deal ‚Äì the main aim of which is fighting climate change, our most pressing problem. David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament "Climate change exposes us to enormous risks now evident to all. We need investments for clean technologies to respond to the millions of young people who took to the streets, and some who also came to this House, to remind us that there is no other planet." 20% of the EU‚Äôs budget is used to fight climate change. The European Parliament hopes to increase it to 30%. Much more needs to be done to protect our planet. The EU is leading the way in taking action.	25	News & Politics	PT4M33S	273	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sSF8uFoSm1M/maxresdefault.jpg		4560	104	22	0	41

Using a complex algorithm, "World Climate‚Äù has created a program that calculates what the increase in global temperature will be by 2100 based on energy consumption and international policy. The game that this algorithm revolves around is basically model UN for the planet: you get a bunch of people in a room, assign each one a country, and then have everybody argue about how to reduce emissions and get the global rise in temperature as low as possible. We‚Äôre going to play this game with a bunch of business students from MIT and see just how hard saving the planet from climate collapse will be.

UK climate change laws should be extended to other areas of "environmental breakdown" with binding targets to protect natural systems, a think tank has said. A new "Sustainable Economy Act" should set legal targets in areas such as wildlife, soil fertility and air quality, in addition to the greenhouse gas limits set by the Climate Change Act, IPPR argues in a new paper. Meteorologist Piers Corbyn, brother of Jeremy, has accused the Met Office of climate "fraud", dishonesty and promoting propaganda after it reported that the 10 hottest years in the UK occurred since 2002.	25	News & Politics	PT11M12S	672	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TMF9aMI-9ek/maxresdefault.jpg	1	71610	2436	110	0	1418

Over the past 20 years, wild reindeer and caribou populations have declined by more than two million.

However, in common with other commentators on the political right - and within the phenomenon of the 'Intellectual Dark Web', his commentaries on climate change are sceptical. It wasn't so long ago there was a consensus on left and right that climate change was an issue that should be taken seriously - albeit that policy prescriptions might differ markedly. This video argues that we need to get back to that position, and influential independent voices like Professor Peterson's should be leading the charge, not blending in with the sceptical political right mood music. Although this video respectfully takes Professor Jordan Peterson as its point of focus, it is really an argument that climate change should be much more positively championed by the political right, albeit in a different way to their opponents. This video, like the author, takes neither a left nor right position politically - but simply argues that climate change should be taken seriously by both.

Far from dramatically reducing since the 'historic' Paris agreement in 2015, those emissions have actually started to creep back up. The world is now catastrophically off track to meet any of the lower pathways set out by the IPCC special report published in 2018. We know what we must do. So why aren't we doing it.? This week we look at a new report just out from the International Renewable Energy Agency, which provides a stark assessment of what's required.

Global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3¬∞C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people‚Äôs lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2¬∞C and even, as asked by the latest science, to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels. Thankfully, we have the Paris Agreement ‚Äì a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres is calling on all leaders to come to New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.	25	News & Politics	PT4M8S	248	2d	sd	false			1086850	9428	9670	0	5564

"You have stolen my childhood and my dreams with your empty words," Thunberg said at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York. "You're failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you," she added. Thunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailboat last month so she could appear at the summit. She and other youth activists led international climate strikes on Friday in an attempt to garner awareness ahead of the UN's meeting of political and business leaders.

Despite the fact that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real and serious, a number of people express doubt. This stands in stark contrast to virtually every other country on the planet. What is the cause of this skepticism? Looking at the situation through evolutionary and philosophical lenses, Dr. White will explore the possibility that the skepticism is the product of a central but potentially dangerous feature of American culture‚Äî ‚ÄúAmerican exceptionalism.‚Äù Dr. White is the Founder and Executive Director of IBECC: The International Business Ethics Case Competition, and the Conrad N.

Thunberg, visibly emotional, said in shaky but stern remarks at the opening of the summit that the generations that have polluted the most have burdened her and her generation with the extreme impacts of climate change. "This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you," she said. "You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," Thunberg said. Days after millions of young people took to the streets worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations General Assembly were to try to inject fresh momentum into stalling efforts to curb carbon emissions.

BECCS scrubs the CO2 out of the exhaust and sequesters it underground, thus taking CO2 out of the air via that plants and putting it into the ground. Direct Air Capture With DAC, giant carbon scrubbers pull CO2 out of the air, after which the CO2 can be used to produce other items like fuel. Two companies that are leading in this field are Carbon Engineering and Climeworks. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection SAI is, basically, creating an artificial volcano. The Mount Pinatubo eruption of 1991 cooled the planet by half a degree for 18 months. By flying a fleet of SAI Lofters (SAILs) regularly into the upper atmosphere, we could spread particulates around the planet and cool the atmosphere. Space Solar Shield By creating a giant solar shield at the L1 Lagrange point, we could block up to 2% of the sun's rays, enough to alter the amount of heat getting trapped by the atmosphere.

The Little Ice Age was a period of global cooling that occurred from the 13th to the 19th centuries. This cooling was likely caused by a number of factors, including unusual solar activity and volcanic eruptions. The Little Ice Age greatly impacted human social orders, especially during the 17th century. When the climate changed, and weather became unpredictable, the world changed profoundly. Poor harvests led to hunger, which led to even less productivity, which even resulted in violent upheaval in a lot of places. All this from a little change in the temperature? Definitely.

I am 15 years old. I am from Sweden. I speak on behalf of Climate Justice Now. Many people say that Sweden is just a small country and it doesn't matter what we do. But I've learned you are never too small to make a difference. And if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to. But to do that, we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be. You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like is. Even that burden you leave to us children. But I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money. Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few. The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself. We have not come here to beg world leaders to care. You have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.

In fact, 97 percent of published reports agree that climate change is fuelled by manmade greenhouse gases. But while there is overwhelming consensus within the scientific community, climate change remains a contentious topic in politics in the United States. In this episode, TechKnow examines the debate over climate change. Lindsay Moran travels to Washington, DC to look at what is at stake in the debate. Politicians fall into two camps: those who believe in human-induced climate change and those who don't. When asked why climate change is so politically charged, John Holden, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, tells us: "I think the most fundamental reason is this misperception that being in favour of addressing the climate change challenge is to be against jobs and the economy." Shini Somara heads to Miami, Florida, where there simply isn't time for a debate over whether climate change is a legitimate threat. The state is already facing the immediate effects of rising sea levels. According to climate scientist Ben Kirtman, Florida is the epicentre for climate change impacts. Rising sea levels are already affecting the lives of Miami coastline residents. Some have faced property damage from rising water, while others reflect on the reality of relocation. "I've been here for my entire lifetime," says Dan Kipnis, a Miami resident and environmental activist. "I know for a fact I'm going to have to leave." Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine says he cannot afford to be concerned with the politics of climate change. "As mayor I don't have the liberty or time to debate why climate change is happening. All I have is the opportunity to fix it," he says. "That bay is not Republican, it's not Democrat, it knows no limits." City officials are moving quickly to keep the city dry by installing pumps and raising buildings and streets. The infrastructure is expensive, and applying for funding from the state or federal level again highlights the political divides surrounding climate change. "When they are trying to get resources from the state of Florida," says climate scientist Ben Kirtman, "they can't really talk about the climate change part of it." - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/	25	News & Politics	PT24M8S	1448	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wYJ9ChqFZs/maxresdefault.jpg	1	11094	126	8	0	48

Reports that state, repeatedly, that a consensus exists that arctic ice is melting, ocean levels are rising, ocean pH is changing (and not getting better), global temperatures are rising. Then he read reports that say the above is not true. Arctic ice is actually growing and at astounding rates, ocean levels are not rising and while the temperature has gone up, it is insignificant. Stuart looked up reports that are cited from either side of the argument and, within minutes, realized he did not have the appropriate knowledge to begin to understand what they mean. They are complex, they are extremely specific because science demands that the hypothesis focus on defined elements. The results of an individual experiment are just that and need to be taken in the context of the whole, which is challenging because the world we live in is extremely complicated. Stuart reached out to a wide range of people who read the reports differently from one another. This week he read in a Canadian newspaper that the World Meteorological Organization, a trusted source, says Canada had a very cold 2019. So he looked it up. He couldn‚Äôt find that statement, instead he read, ‚Äú2019 concludes a decade of exceptional global heat and high-impact weather.‚Äù Where is the truth? In this Conversation That Matters, he talks online to Environment Canada Climate Scientist Greg Flato about climate and he clears up a number of issues. And because the conversation extended far beyond the broadcast window, we have broken this Conversation into two parts. Here now is part one. --- Simon Fraser University‚Äôs Centre for Dialogue presents Conversations That Matter.

MORE INFO BELOW. Since its publication Cook et al. 2013 has been persistently attacked, despite the fact that several other studies have found similar results (90-100% agreement of climate scientists). Now the authors of seven of the leading studies into scientific consensus on human-caused global warming have come together to confirm what we know: there is a consensus on the consensus. Humans are causing global warming. In this video, we discuss how their work has been misrepresented and why the public is largely unaware of the high-level of scientific agreement. The new paper is available at http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002 For more information and expert interviews see this post by Real Skeptic http://www.realskeptic.com/2015/09/21...

Bill Gates is backing the first high-altitude experiment of one radical approach called solar geoengineering. It's meant to mimic the effects of a giant volcanic eruption. Thousands of planes would fly at high altitudes, spraying millions of tons of particles around the planet to create a massive chemical cloud that would cool the surface. "Modeling studies have found that it could reduce the intensity of heat waves, for instance, apparently it could reduce the rate of sea level rise. It could reduce the intensity of tropical storms," said Andy Parker, project director at the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative. The technology is not far from being ready and it's affordable, but it could cause massive changes in regional weather patterns and eradicate blue sky. "These consequences might be horrific. They might involve things like mass famine, mass flooding, drought of kinds that will affect very large populations," said Stephen Gardiner, author of "A Perfect Moral Storm: The Ethical Tragedy of Climate Change." Watch the video to learn how it would work and hear the debate around the ethics and efficacy of solar geoengineering. ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision ¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office Hadley Centre said we are "seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3C". While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's "common sense" that human-induced heating is playing a role. Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record.

Not by rehashing the same data and facts we've been discussing for years, says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. In this inspiring, pragmatic talk, Hayhoe shows how the key to having a real discussion is to connect over shared values like family, community and religion -- and to prompt people to realize that they already care about a changing climate. "We can't give in to despair," she says. "We have to go out and look for the hope we need to inspire us to act -- and that hope begins with a conversation, today."

Climate is also a powerful backdrop to see the often under-valued importance of farm women. Dr. Amber Fletcher is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Social Studies, University of Regina. Her research examines how climate change and major policy changes affect women in agriculture. Dr. Fletcher‚Äôs research has been published in international peer-reviewed journals and books. She is a member of the United Nations World Water Assessment Programme‚Äôs international working group on gender and water indicators, and has served as an official delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.

What if we could reverse global warming with just one methodological shift? Can the way we farm radically impact not just our output but also overwhelming wide-ranging concerns for our environment, hunger, and poverty? Ben Dobson has a unique, personal perspective on how we can make universal changes. Growing up on an organic farm in Hillsdale, NY, Dobson was raised in an environment that was conscious of the ground. Having established multiple organic agriculture businesses in the Northeast, dabbled in coffee importation from Haiti, and assisted in producing and exporting organic products from the Dominican Republic, Dobson has now returned to his roots. He is currently working to plan and transition Stone House Farm in Livingston, NY, into an organic and sustainable producer. Implementing the ‚Äúno-till‚Äù method, the transition of Stone House Farm is based on holistic management of our land to retain and rebalance the earth and bring healthy grains and meats to local markets. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT9M46S	586	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yp1i8_JFsao/maxresdefault.jpg	1	41767	626	14	0	58

Here, she explains what it‚Äôs like to live in a place where the effects of climate change are already being felt. Ninety percent of Lake Chad has disappeared in Ibrahim‚Äôs own lifetime. Around 40 million people depend on the lake and its resources. The shrinking of the lake forces men to leave their communities during the dry season to look for work in the city, leaving women and children behind to manage the crops. Chad is already struggling with poverty and frequent conflicts. Sixty-three percent of its people are destitute, and most of the country lives by subsistence farming. People in Chad are turning to traditional knowledge to ensure their survival. Across the Sahel desert, many farmers are reviving an old technique called zai, which involves digging pits to catch rainwater. The technique concentrates nutrients and can increase crop yields by up to 500%.

When ticks feed off these hosts, the ticks become infected with it. And the bacteria can then be transmitted to humans via tick bites. There are numerous ways to prevent tick bites, but the best protection is vigilance. Whether you're going hiking, camping, or just a stroll in the woods, check for ticks that may have become attached. The sooner the tick is removed, the lesser your chances of being infected with Lyme disease.

Sorkin also wrote about the interview in Tuesday‚Äôs New York Times. ‚ÄúThis is bigger,‚Äù he argued, calling on investors and corporate America to help combat climate change. ‚ÄúIt requires more planning. It requires more public-private connections together to solve these problems. And I do believe many of these problems could be solved, but the actions have to begin now.‚Äù Fink, whose BlackRock has nearly $7 trillion in assets under management, used his annual letter to the world‚Äôs biggest companies to sound the alarm. ‚ÄúClimate change has become a defining factor in companies‚Äô long-term prospects. ‚Ä¶ But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.‚Äù BlackRock will put ‚Äúsustainability at the center of our investment approach,‚Äù he wrote ‚Äî from portfolio construction to launching new investment products that screen fossil fuels. ‚ÄúFor now over eight years, I‚Äôve been writing CEO letters about ‚Äòlong-termism,‚Äò‚Äù Fink told CNBC. ‚ÄúNothing could be more ‚Äòlong-termism‚Äô than climate change.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe in the science. But I did not write it as an environmentalist. I wrote the letter as a capitalist,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMy job is, as a capitalist, to help prepare our clients for the redistribution of capital. And more importantly, through that is to provide them with an investment portfolio that will outperform.‚Äù Fink‚Äôs comments come as business leaders, policymakers and investors prepare to travel to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum next week. President Donald Trump, a skeptic that human behavior causes climate change, plans to attend this year after canceling last year because of the government shutdown. ‚ÄúWe need to have a conversation with every government in the world, including our government, to be better prepared for this,‚Äù Fink told CNBC. ‚ÄúWe need to be spending large sums of money on infrastructure to be more prepared for this.‚Äù However, Fink acknowledged, ‚ÄúIf we are going to be fair and just, we need to also focus on this transition. Many people are going be left behind.‚Äù He said governments need to have long-term plans to deal with the shift. ‚ÄúThe climate change is going to require a huge energy transition. It‚Äôs going be 40 or 50 years.‚Äù Fink, a Democrat, has a history of addressing social issues in his annual CEO letters. Two years ago, he called on companies to have a purpose beyond profits.

Brexit Party MEP Rupert Lowe denied climate change being the primarily cause of Austalia's bush fires. He told MEPs: "The cult of climate change marches on with no definitive evidence to support or deny the factual accuracy of their assertions.

Increasing numbers of scientists, farmers and ranchers are implementing innovative land use practices that build fertile soil and sequester atmospheric carbon¬†¬†These methods of land management have the potential to provide us with nutritious food, improved human health, cleaner water, and a healthier planet for all. World wide, most soils are depleted of carbon. The atmosphere contains an excess of carbon in the form of CO2, a climate change causing gas. What if that CO2 could¬†be removed and stored in our carbon-hungry soil through land management practices? Find out how in¬†The Soil Solution. The Soil Solution to Climate Change¬†was one of thirteen films featured in A Climate of Change Tour sponsored by 350.org, TRUST campaign and Wild and Scenic Film Festival.¬† It has screened at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, Sausalito Film Festival, Awareness Festival, Davis Film Festival, Wild and Scenic Film Tour 2013 and the One Earth Film Festival.¬† Anything that we do to increase soil fertility could be a step in reversing climate change.¬† Here's what you can do: ¬† What Goes Up Must Come Down!- Cover bare soil with¬†plants!¬†Fertile soil is a natural sink for atmospheric carbon; the very same carbon that contributes to climate change.¬† Excess carbon can be pulled out of the atmosphere by photosynthesis and into plants and the soil where it can have a beneficial effect.¬† Support Farmers and Ranchers Who Treat The Soil Like Gold- Buy from local food producers who increase soil fertility by using climate friendly agricultural methods including no or low-till plowing,¬†cover cropping, composting and organic farming. If you eat meat, buy grass-fed beef from ranchers who practice holistic or rotational grazing methods that mimic the natural patterns found in nature.¬† If You Grow Your Own Food, Grow Your Own Soil- If you grow food, take care of your soil.¬†Increase soil fertility by avoiding the use of toxic synthetic pesticides, fertilizers and herbicides on your garden or lawn. These poisons kill microorganisms that reside in and on the soil.¬† These organisms perform numerous ecosystem services; including providing nutrients for plants, creating soil humus and loam and increasing plant health.¬† The soil is filled with billions of unemployed microorganisms ready and willing to take on the job of providing nutrients to plants and indirectly to you.¬† Increase Your Skill Set- If you feel hopeless about climate change- it‚Äôs time to take action. Learn how to grow food without increasing atmospheric CO2.¬†Take a course in organic gardening or regenerative farming. If you work with animals, learn about the benefits of rotational¬†grazing.¬† Get to know your local soil microbes and the¬†Soil Food Web.	27	Education	PT28M42S	1722	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BxiXJnZraxk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	89326	1163	38	0	55

The study says rice and soybean yields have also decreased in some places -- but increased in others. In the words of the researchers: "For soybeans and rice, winners and losers largely balanced out."The researchers studied climate trends and global crop production from between nineteen eighty and two thousand eight. They found that climate changes "are already exerting a considerable drag on yield growth" and may have affected food prices. The study used computer models linking crop yields to weather. Yield is the amount produced for each hectare or acre. The researchers compared the results to what the yields might have been without climate changes. They found that corn production decreased by almost four percent and wheat production decreased by five and a half percent.Warming temperatures were reported in almost all of Europe, much of Asia and some of South America and Africa. During the study period most countries had greater temperature changes from year to year than they have had historically. But the study says the United States was an important exception -- at least so far. Corn and wheat yields in most of North America remained about the same. Russia's wheat yields decreased the most. The largest loss in corn yields were in China and Brazil. The report is in the journal Science.One of the researchers was economist Wolfram Schlenker at Columbia University in New York and the National Bureau of Economic Research. He says the report can serve as a planning tool for policy makers. He says: "If you are worried about rising food prices, it might be good to funnel some research into breeding for heat tolerance and maybe even drought tolerance." Jeffrey Stark is with a public policy organization called the Foundation for Environmental Security and Stability. He recently described the effects of climate change on pastoralists in Uganda who travel with their cattle. Many say they have to travel farther in search of pasture and water because of unpredictable changes in seasonal weather patterns. And that search can bring them into conflict with farmers facing problems of their own. For VOA Special English, I'm Carolyn Presutti.

At least eight people have been killed since September, including two firefighters who died on Thursday when their truck was hit by a falling tree. Prime Minister Scott Morrison cut short his holiday to Hawaii and issued a rare public apology in response to mounting anger. Australia‚Äôs not alone in having to deal with ferocious fires this year. There were more than 16-hundred recorded in Europe, large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of hectares of land and hundreds of buildings in California. And we've seen wildfires in the Arctic too - more than 100 - a sign of warming conditions in one of the coldest places on Earth. Is the political will there to tackle the problem?

As families flee water scarcity, crop failure and rising sea levels, the refugee crisis is bound to wreak havoc on the international system with tremendous economic and political consequences. Russia, however, is likely to be insulated from the most disastrous effects. In fact, the Russians actually stand to benefit from climate change in numerous ways, and policymakers in Moscow believe this is their license to global resurgence.

And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.

In "Climate Change is Simple" he describes the causes and effects of climate change in blunt, plain terms. On April 16, 2012, speakers and attendees gathered at TEDxTheEvergreenStateCollege: Hello Climate Change to reflect on the ability -- and responsibility -- of formal and informal education to inspire and empower action in this era of climate change. In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)	28	Science & Technology	PT17M44S	1064	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A7ktYbVwr90/maxresdefault.jpg	1	272306	2539	458	0	2487

It's not really science fiction anymore. While we're probably not going to be bringing back dinosaurs anytime soon - the DNA is just too damaged over that time - there is the potential for bringing back prehistoric mammals, and even animals that we're losing in the current extinction event. Some think that bringing back mammoths - or something like them - could help climate change by feeding on the bushes that absorb heat and thaw the permafrost. Other species, like passenger pigeons, which once migrated in flocks so big they would darken the sky for days at a time, may have served to help keep forests healthy, and bringing them back could help with our forests. And others, like the saber-tooth tiger, could be just for fun.	28	Science & Technology	PT16M26S	986	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMTwbV9UqHA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	282714	11028	288	0	1421

We can win this battle, as long as we don‚Äôt give in to climate despair and convince ourselves that it‚Äôs already lost. The solutions are within our grasp, but they depend on political will that will only be driven by much wider public demand for actions that cut carbon, create many millions of jobs, and build stronger, healthier, more resilient communities. Follow Mitchell on Twitter @mitchellbeer Mitchell Beer is Publisher of The Energy Mix, a thrice-weekly e-digest on climate change, energy, and carbon-free futures, and President of Smarter Shift Inc., an Ottawa-based content and communications firm. He‚Äôs been involved with renewable energy and energy efficiency since 1977, with climate change since 1997. He‚Äôs currently interested in ways of building wider, louder public demand for fast action on climate solutions, starting from the interests and priorities people already woke up with this morning. One of his proudest moments was building a model wind turbine out of wooden stir sticks with his then-11-year-old daughter, and improv theatre practices are often the best part of his week.

Climate change is an urgent topic of discussion among politicians, journalists and celebrities...but what do scientists say about climate change? Does the data validate those who say humans are causing the earth to catastrophically warm? Richard Lindzen, an MIT atmospheric physicist and one of the world's leading climatologists, summarizes the science behind climate change.

I‚Äôve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let‚Äôs clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called‚Äî‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation‚Äôs International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man‚Äôs burning of fossil fuels‚Äîoil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don‚Äôt see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We‚Äôre usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes‚Äîthe sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960‚Äôs have man‚Äôs greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that ‚ÄúThe long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.‚Äù For the complete script, visit https://www.prageru.com/videos/climate-change-what-do-scientists-say	27	Education	PT5M5S	305	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OwqIy8Ikv-c/maxresdefault.jpg	1	2300651	48617	16165	0	13881

Dan get's questioned about Global warming and why people like him and Donald Trump simply seem to not care about this issue. Dan responds with his own answer to the question and claims that global warming is a fraud. Until now only those who attended the exclusive event saw Dan offer to fight anyone in the room‚Ä¶ ...brand climate change complete bullshit‚Ä¶ ...and predict which countries Trump would soon bomb back to the stone age.

This phenomenon pushes winegrowers to conquer new lands, moving ever further towards the poles. Temperatures are expected to rise from 3¬∞ to 5¬∞C by 2050, accompanied by a decrease in summertime precipitation, much more frequent heat waves (over 35¬∞C) that are fatal to grapevines, increased soil erosion and irrigation problems. This catastrophic scenario for an entire economy is a reality. Tomorrow's wines may no longer taste the same, with certain grands crus having completely lost their current typicity, and the reshuffling of the winemaking cards may prove a fatal blow for certain regions, including southern Europe, France and California. This investigative documentary surveys the research carried out and the decisions made by both vineyard owners and scientists to tackle the question of global warming. ----- Subscribe to wocomoDOCS for more documentaries: https://goo.gl/sBmGkp Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/wocomo/ ----- Director: Eric Michaud Production: Saison Cinq Year: 2010	27	Education	PT51M55S	3115	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/itgNMmhcXPA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	28587	194	11	0	23
