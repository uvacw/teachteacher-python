# Day 3: Collecting and reading data

| Time (indication) | Topic |
|-|-|
| 9.30-11.00 | Data Collection 1: We will dive into handling data beyond typical tabular datasets (such as the csv files from Tuesday) and get an introduction to the JSON format, which is the de-facto standard for (online) data exchange. We will also get to know our first API (which uses this format). |
| 11.00-12.00 | Exercises |
| 13.00-14.00 | Data Collection 2: APIs and scraping. We will look more in detail into different APIs and how they can be used for data collection. We will also briefly talk about scraping which is highly relevant as a data collection technique (for instance, for theses), but also a bit too complex to cover in detail in this workshop. |
| 14:00 - 15:30 | Practice |
| 15:30 - 16:30 | Teaching presentations & general Q&A |
| 16:30 - 17:00 | Closure / next steps |
