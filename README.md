# teachteacher-python
"Teaching the Teacher" resources for colleagues that want to get started using computational methods in their teaching (using Python)

## Purpose

This repository contains materials for colleagues who are new to teaching computational methods but want to do so in the future. In particular, this holds true for the following courses, but the tips and resources also apply to future yet-to-be-developed courses:

## Structure of the ``Teaching the teacher'' course

As a pilot, we are holding a five-day course in which we combine 
- teaching the necessary Python skills
- teaching how to teach these skills
- exercising and reflecting on best teaching practices.


## Additional resources

A list of additional resources that could be of interest:

- A 5-day workshop by Anne and Damian on Machine Learning in Python (for social scientists with no or minimal previous Python knowledge): https://github.com/annekroon/gesis-ml-learning/

- (Forthcoming on https://cssbook.net and in print with Wiley): Van Atteveldt, W., Trilling, D., Arcila, C. (in press):  Computational Analysis of Communication: A practical introduction to the analysis of texts, networks, and images with code examples in Python and R
