| 13:00-14:00   | [NLP II](https://github.com/uvacw/teachteacher-python/blob/main/day4/day4-afternoon.pdf):  In the second lecture of the day, we will delve a bit deeper in NLP approaches. We discuss different types of vectorizers (i.e., count and tfidf) and discuss the possibilities NER in spacy.  |
